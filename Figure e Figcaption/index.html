    <p>The Taj Mahal is widely recognized as "the jewel of Muslim art in India and   
        one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded  
         by many as the finest example of Mughal architecture, a style that combines elements  
         from Islamic, Persian, Ottoman, Turkish and Indian architectural styles.</p>
