HTML <header> tag is used as a container of introductory content or navigation links.
Generally a <header> element contains one or more heading elements, logo or icons or 
author's information.

You can use several <header> elements in one document, but a <header> element cannot be
placed within a <footer>, <address> or another <header> element.
