The <datalist> element specifies a set of pre-defined options for an <input> element.
It provides a list of predefined options for the users to select data.
Its not only saves the time of a user but also reduces errors, because the user has
less likelihood of making a spelling mistake. The list attribute of the input element
is used to bind it together with a datalist element.
